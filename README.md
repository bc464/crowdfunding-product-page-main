### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### Continued development

Exposure to projects to identify areas for further learning within the Frontend Mentor projects.
Thereis still alot of learning to be done.
Some of the bigger areas where I failed to complete this projects are with:
1. the bookmark, including changing the svg color. 
2. the commas in the totals
3. the ability to make a pledge and see the result only works on 'Bamboo Stand'. I need to learn how in JavaScript to enable 'Black Edition Stand' to also be interactive.
4. the pledge button in terms of getting a dollar sign into the input field. the field works to be able to submit $25 or any other amount entered. Just does not look like the finished provided projecct.
